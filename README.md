# JavaScript-Random-PW-C3

## Description
In this challenge, we were asked to create Javascript code to create a random password within certain guidelines. The code for the html and CSS was already given. Some of the Javascript code was given as well. We were tasked with coding the "generatePassword" function. The guidelines for the password were that it should be between 8 and 128 characters, and which types of characters were to be used. We were asked to take inputs for: <ul>
    <li>Password length (Had to be between 8 and 128 characters)</li>
    <li>Types of characters desired in the password (Capital letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters)</li>
    </ul>
Once those inputs were taken in, we had to generate the password based on the length desired. After that was completed, a string of the password was returned to the already given code. That code would then display the result of the password on the webpage.
